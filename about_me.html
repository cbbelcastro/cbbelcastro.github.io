       My name is Connor Belcastro. I am a senior at Princeton University, where I study philosophy and serve as a captain of the varsity men's golf team. When not studying or on the golf course, I play drums for the post-hardcore band Villanelle, work on various creative writing projects, and play pool at Cottage Club.
